## My favorite SUV
After putting 47k+ miles on my 2016 Buick, I am still convinced it is the best ride for the money.  If you can find seats that are more comfortable please let me know.  Before purchasing this Enclave, I test drove  the more expensive sporty as well as luxurious versions with their stiff suspension and their expensive but hard leather seats and the Buick easily won.  Best handling and seating with thoughtful extras.  Air-conditioned seats as well as heated seats and steering wheel. AC (alternating current like your house), USB, 12v DC outlets (cigarrete lighter type outlets are throughout the car in thoughtful and convenient places.
